📘 Project Documentation — Wavelength: Voice-First Journaling Companion
1. Overview

Wavelength is an AI-powered, voice-first journaling companion that helps people reflect on their emotions, reduce stress, and build a consistent journaling habit.
Unlike traditional journaling apps, Wavelength removes “blank page anxiety” by letting users speak naturally, while providing empathetic, counselor-style reflections and privacy-by-default storage.

2. Goal

Make journaling frictionless → voice input lowers the barrier for people who avoid writing.

Encourage reflection, not just logging → empathetic prompts and weekly summaries help users spot meaningful patterns.

Ensure trust and privacy → local-first design with an optional connected mode for richer insights.

3. Problem Statement

Many people want to journal for mental wellness, but:

They don’t know what to write → “blank page anxiety.”

They stop journaling because typing feels like a chore.

They can’t see patterns in their emotions and behaviors.

Existing apps feel like static notebooks, not empathetic companions.

Users are cautious about sharing sensitive reflections with the cloud, fearing privacy breaches.

4. Our Solution

A private, empathetic, intelligent journaling companion that:

Uses voice journaling as the primary input (speak your thoughts).

Provides counselor-style reflections (OARS method: Open question, Affirmation, Reflection, Summary).

Generates weekly summaries showing wins, stressors, and patterns.

Operates in two clear modes: Private Mode (offline, local-only) and Connected Mode (opt-in, prosody-aware empathy).

5. How It Works
Core Loop (3 minutes/day)

Talk → User taps 🎤 and speaks for ~1 minute.

Reflect → App transcribes locally, tags themes, and responds empathetically.

Save → Entry stored securely with tags, tone, and counselor note.

Review → At week’s end, user gets a Weekly Brief summarizing patterns.

6. Detailed User Story

Maya, a busy professional, opens Wavelength after work.

Home Screen:

She sees a large 🎤 “Talk” button, with a lock icon showing Private Mode active.

Recording:

Maya speaks: “I’m anxious about tomorrow’s review. I keep imagining the worst.”

On-device STT transcribes her speech.

Reflection:

The app replies: “Sounds like tomorrow’s review feels heavy—especially the ‘what-ifs.’ What might make it 10% calmer?”

Entry Saved:

Transcript, tags (work, anxiety), and counselor reflection are saved locally.

Weekly Brief (Sunday):

Shows insights like: “You felt calmer on mornings with walks. Mentions of ‘review’ linked to tense tone.”

Suggestion: “Try a 60s rehearsal before review meetings.”

7. Privacy & Security
🔒 Private Mode (Default)

Everything local:

STT via whisper.cpp / OS speech recognizer.

Sentiment/themes via local ML models.

Data stored in encrypted SQLite/MMKV, no cloud sync.

Offline capable: journaling works even without internet.

UI badge: “Private Mode: nothing leaves your device.”

🌐 Connected Mode (Optional, Opt-in)

Prosody analysis via APIs (e.g., Hume).

Only minimal audio stream leaves the device (tone features).

Transcript & reflections remain local.

Transparency panel: clear explanation of what’s sent.

UI badge: “Connected Mode: richer empathy, optional.”

Security Principles

Encryption at rest (SQLCipher) and in transit (TLS 1.3).

Least privilege tokens for any API use.

Export/Wipe controls → user can own/delete their data anytime.

Responsible AI guardrails:

No therapy/diagnosis.

Crisis detection: interrupts journaling, shows 988 or local hotlines.

Bias disclosure: users can edit or dismiss auto emotion tags.

8. App Navigation & UI Flow

Home (Daily Hub)

Big 🎤 button, mode indicator, daily prompt.

STT:

Private Mode → whisper.cpp via native bridge / OS recognizers.

Connected Mode → optional cloud APIs.

Storage: SQLite (with SQLCipher), MMKV (secure key-value).

NLP/AI:

Sentiment analysis → small local model / heuristics.

Counselor reflections → LLM with OARS prompt.

Weekly summary → LLM summarization.

Visualization: Victory Native / Skia for charts.
