## Intro

**Wavelength** is a voice-first, AI-powered journaling companion that makes self-reflection accessible to everyone while maintaining **absolute privacy by design**. Unlike traditional journaling apps, Wavelength eliminates "blank page anxiety" through natural speech input and provides empathetic, counselor-style responses using therapeutic AI techniques.

The app operates in two modes: **Private Mode** (completely offline, local-only processing) and **Connected Mode** (optional cloud enhancement), ensuring users maintain complete control over their personal data.

## üö® Problem Statement

### Accessibility Barriers

- **Visual Impairment**: Traditional text-based journaling excludes blind and visually impaired users
- **Hearing Impairment**: Audio-only solutions exclude deaf and hard-of-hearing users
- **Motor Limitations**: Typing can be challenging for users with dexterity issues

### Psychological Barriers

- **Blank Page Anxiety**: 73% of people want to journal but struggle with where to start
- **Consistency Issues**: Traditional journaling feels like work, leading to 85% abandonment within 30 days
- **Limited Self-Awareness**: Users can't identify emotional patterns without manual analysis

### Privacy Crisis

- **Data Vulnerability**: Users hesitate to share intimate reflections with cloud-based services
- **Corporate Surveillance**: Growing awareness of how personal data is monetized
- **Therapeutic Confidentiality**: Need for journal data to remain as private as traditional therapy

---

## üí° Solution Overview

### üîí Privacy-First Architecture

Wavelength operates primarily in **Private Mode**‚Äîensuring nothing ever leaves the user's device. All AI processing happens locally using Apple's on-device frameworks.

### ‚ôø Universal Accessibility

- **For Blind/Visually Impaired**: Voice-first interface with comprehensive VoiceOver support and haptic feedback
- **For Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing**: Visual transcription, vibration alerts, and text-based interaction options
- **For Motor-Impaired**: Switch Control compatibility and voice activation

### üîÑ Dual-Mode Intelligence

**Private Mode (Default & Recommended)**:

- Complete offline operation with zero data transmission
- Military-grade local encryption
- Equivalent to traditional paper journal confidentiality

**Connected Mode (Optional Enhancement)**:

- Explicit opt-in with transparent data sharing
- Only prosody features (tone, pace) transmitted‚Äînever content
- Enhanced empathy through advanced AI models

### üß† Therapeutic-Grade AI

Uses the OARS method (Open questions, Affirmations, Reflections, Summaries) from professional counseling to provide empathetic responses that encourage deeper self-reflection.
